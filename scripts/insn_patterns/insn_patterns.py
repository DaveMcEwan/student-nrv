# Analyse the instruction trace input through stdin
# Identify the most common instruction patterns (sequences of n instructions)

# Input : Trimmed down instruction trace
# Output :  -  JSON file giving the list of tuples where each instruction
#   pattern is stored with a counter giving how often that pattern has
#   occured. To then be passed into display files. (Optional)
#           -  Formatted list giving the instruction patterns and a counter 
#   detailing how often they've appeared.

# Example to guide use:
# Run the command : python3 scripts/insn_patterns/insn_patterns.py \
#                   -j=<optional json file path> \
#                   < scripts/example-printf.trc
#   while in the base directory
